## Acknowledgements
Part of the back end of this project (the button driven one) was built upon the work of user Mijova (GitHub page: [https://github.com/Mjrovai/MJRoBot-Web-RPi-Robot](https://github.com/Mjrovai/MJRoBot-Web-RPi-Robot)). His work saved me a lot of time of reseach and development. Make sure to check his page out.
